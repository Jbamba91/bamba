This proposal was placed in Above-Average Recommended for Funding

Please find below the Panel=92s feedback regarding your proposal.

What are the strengths of this proposal?

  *   This proposal has the potential of improving farmer livelihoods. Incr=
easing food security for Guam is an important outcome.
  *   The project has strong industry support, including 70 producers that =
comprise the majority of Guam's active farmers. Collaboration among produce=
rs is key to securing the stability of the market.
  *   The train the trainer approach and "building community" between the g=
rowers is a strength of this project.

 What are the weaknesses of this proposal?

  *   The proposal will benefit from a better description of the research p=
lan. Online forms for data collection were not addressed.
  *   Educational materials could benefit from posts on YouTube/social medi=
a.
  *   The proposal does not state how adoption will be quantified. Although=
 it is stated that farmers learn best from their peers and are more likely =
to adopt practices, there is no mention of whether the number of producers =
will be counted to see how many compiled their yield data.
  *   Budget justification lacks details.
  *   The proposal will benefit if all acronyms are spelled.

Overall Comments:

  *   This project will provide a baseline for production data which will b=
enefit future research and extension efforts in Guam.
  *   This project has an important food and subsistence planning aspect to=
 bolster food security on the island.
  *   This proposal only addresses one of Western SARE's goals - farmer liv=
elihood/quality of life. There is some mention of environmentally friendly =
practices (mulching) but not fully developed.

o implement it has changed, please feel free to get in touch with me at you=
r earliest convenience.
